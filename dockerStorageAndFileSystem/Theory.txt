When docker install it creates file structure like (01.png).
     var/lib/docker
          |- ausf
          |- containers
          |- volumes
          |- images
          |- networks 

Create volume by using this command amd it would be inside the docker's default file system as above
     docker volume create data_volume   // here data_volume is volume name

like this:-
 var/lib/docker
     |- ausf
     |- containers
     |- volumes
     |- images
     |- networks 
     |- data_volume 

Two types of mount in docker:-
     1. volume mount :- volume will be mounted inside default volume directory of docker file system
     2. Bind mount :- any location (Full path) of a directory on host machine.


Allocate the volume to container :
     Volume mount:- 
          docker run -v  data_volume:var/lib/mysql mysql  // here data_volume is created volume in side docker file system and var/lib/mysql is mysql container volume

     Bind mount :-
          docker run -v  /data/mysql:var/lib/mysql mysql   //here /data/mysql is directory on your host machine

But now days this command is using
  docker run --mount type=bind, source=data/mysql, target=var/lib/mysql mysql


  Who is responsible for managing volume related things
  -->> Storage Driver (07.png)
     Aufs (for ubunutu)

 Docker will choose best storage driver based on OS, different storage driver provides different performance, stability, characteristics 
 so you may choose based on need of your organization.
