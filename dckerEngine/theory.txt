docker usages namesapce to isolate namesapces (03.png)

namesapce : processId
as we know docker usages host os.
when your system bootstarp there is only one process with unique Id and once it's finished we would have multiple process with their uniqueIds.
Containers treate itself as an issolated system so their processes also have different processIds.
We list all(same) services on hosts as well as inside container but they have different processIds.
